# Run on both PRs and pushes to the main branch.
# It may seem redundant to run tests on main, since we disallow pushing directly
# to main and all PRs get tested before merging.
#
# But due to how GitHub Actions isolates caches, we need to run the tests on
# main so that caches are available to new PRs. The caches created when testing
# PR code cannot be re-used outside of testing that PR.
#
# See the GitHub Actions documentation here:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache
